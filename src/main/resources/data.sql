('MIE100', 'Dynamics', 'CORE', 0.5, 'This course on Newtonian mechanics considers the interactions which influence 2-D, curvilinear motion. These interactions are described in terms of the concepts of force, work, momentum and energy. Initially the focus is on the kinematics and kinetics of particles. Then, the kinematics and kinetics of systems of particles and solid bodies are examined. Finally, simple harmonic motion is discussed. The occurrence of dynamic motion in natural systems, such as planetary motion, is emphasized. Applications to engineered systems are also introduced'),
('MIE451', 'Decision Support System', 'TECHNICAL', 0.5, 'Provides students with an understanding of the role of a decision support system in an organization, its components, and the theories and techniques used to construct them. Focuses on information analysis to support organizational decision-making needs and covers topics including information retrieval, descriptive and predictive modeling using machine learning and data mining, recommendation systems, and effective visualization and communication of analytical results.'),
('APS360', 'Applied Fundamentals of Deep Learning', 'TECHNICAL', 0.5, 'A basic introduction to the history, technology, programming and applications of the fast evolving field of deep learning. Topics to be covered may include neural networks, autoencoders/decoders, recurrent neural networks, natural language processing, and generative adversarial networks. Special attention will be paid to fairness and ethics issues surrounding machine learning. An applied approach will be taken, where students get hands-on exposure to the covered techniques through the use of state-of-the-art machine learning software frameworks.'),

Applications covered include: dimensional analysis, hydrostatics, flow visualization, incompressible and compressible frictionless flows, the speed of sound, the momentum principle, viscous flows and selected examples of real fluid flows. The students conduct two hands-on laboratory experiments involving microfluidics and flow visualization, which complement the fluid mechanics lectures and experience technical report writing.'),
('ECE367', 'Matrix Algebra & Optimization', 'TECHNICAL', 0.5, 'This course will provide students with a grounding in optimization methods and the matrix algebra upon which they are based. The first past of the course focuses on fundamental building blocks in linear algebra and their geometric interpretation: matrices, their use to represent data and as linear operators, and the matrix decompositions (such as eigen-, spectral-, and singular-vector decompositions) that reveal structural and geometric insight. The second part of the course focuses on optimization, both unconstrained and constrained, linear and non-linear, as well as convex and nonconvex; conditions for local and global optimality, as well as basic classes of optimization problems are discussed. Applications from machine learning, signal processing, and engineering are used to illustrate the techniques developed.');
